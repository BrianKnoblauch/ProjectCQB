Due to this project being developed with the MASM32 toolset, it needs to adhere to all the unique requirements of the MASM32 license.  http://masm32.com/license.htm  This means it's unable to be licensed under the standard licenses available.

The code is specifically being written for my particular machine and configuration as an experiment.  It is unsafe to run this on any other machine/configuration.
