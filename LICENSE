Requirements:
First and foremost, due to this project being developed with the MASM32 toolset, it/all usage needs to adhere to the unique requirements of the MASM32 license.  http://masm32.com/license.htm  This license is very unique and makes it unable to be licensed under the common open source standard licenses available.

My Intent:
The code is specifically being written for my particular machine and configuration for fun.  It is potentially unsafe to run this on any other machine/configuration as it is not designed nor tested for compilation or execution on anything other than my own system (and I may well blow up my own system with some error at some point).  The code is public viewable so that I might easily share snippets/sections for discussion/experimentation purposes.  If you're willing to take the risk and copy some or all of the code for your own private (non-commercial) experimentation, have at it.  Just make sure to keep it off of any production environment (or any machine you really care about).  Don't run it on the machine with your only copy of your family photos, etc.
